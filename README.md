# form_project

In this project I will utilize many of the HTML and CSS concepts I've learned up to this point. These include elements beyond the basics (i.e. <div>, <header>, <main>, etc.), pseudo-classes, and most recently forms and their controls. I aim to put together a user-friendly form within an aesthetically pleaseing webpage modeled after a design from "The Odin Project."
